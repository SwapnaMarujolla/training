// EXAMPLE OGF EQUALITY OPERATORS

// Strict Equality Operators
console.log(1===1);//here both the sides of he operator should have same type and same value

// Lose Equality Operator
console.log('1' == 1);
console.log(1 == 1);
// here whatever is there in the left side it sees it in the eight side as well
// if there is a string in he left side it sees a string in the right side even if it is not a string it only looks for the value
